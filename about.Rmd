I am a recent graduate from the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) with a Master of Public Health I have experience in data analysis, R, SAS, and epidemiological methods as well as a strong interest in evidence-based medicine. With these qualifications, I believe I am a strong fit for this opportunity and would be honored to be considered.

My data analysis and epidemiology skills have been honed over the previous two years while attending Columbia University. My relevant coursework at the Mailman School of Public Health included two semesters of applied regression, analysis of categorical data, two semesters of data science, statistical analysis in SAS, and a variety of epidemiology courses. I was able to utilize skills and knowledge from these courses in my prior internship at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. In this role, I used data analysis and biostatistics techniques including multivariable linear regression analysis and analysis of categorical data, and programmed extensively in SAS in order to conduct an exploratory analysis of diabetes in the New York City Tuberculosis population. This analysis was conducted on electronic medical record data in a dataset of over 5,000 records. I was also able to apply skills from my courses at my internship at EcoHealth Alliance, where I gathered and cleaned data, and conducted multivariable regression and geospatial analysis on malaria incidence in Malaysia using R. The data used in this project was reused for my Masterâ€™s thesis where I built a predictive model in R using GAMs to better understand which environmental and social factors were most important when predicting Malaria incidence.
