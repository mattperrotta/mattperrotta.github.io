### A Little Bit About Me

I was born and raised in Boston and left for college in New York City when I attended [Fordham Univertiy](https://www.fordham.edu/) in 2011 and earned a BS in biology. I am currently working towards my MPH at the [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). I am interested in understanding the drivers of zoonotic infectious disease emergence, especially in the context of the changing climate. 

Academics aside, I am an avid hockey fan (played through college) and space enthusiast (maybe one day they'll need epidemiologists on Mars!).
